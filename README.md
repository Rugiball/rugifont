# rugifont
A font I'm making open source, mainly so that rugifon (a conscript I'm creating for english that's based on unifon, also the namesake) has its own font

Probably gonna put various conscripts into the private use areas

This is very wip lol

# how to build it
All you need to do is put it in some font maker (which I use glyphr, not sponsored) that you can import svgs into, and just put them in the slots you want

It may be a quite tedious, but if you're up for it, there's the font

# roadmap
Actually build the font

Put in cyrillic, greek, davangari, ipa (alphabet), math symbols, armenian, arabic, & other scripts

Keep it dyslexic-friendly & legible
